# we can iterate over a string character by character
# for i in name:

# but strings are immutable, their values cannot be changed

# name[3] = 'r'
# print(name) ->  gives a TypeError

# we can check if a specific letter or a pattern is in a string:
# this returns a boolean value
# c = 'ahu' in name
